## Task Description 

### Here are user stories that should be covered:

- As a user, I can view my grocery list

- As a user, I can add, edit and delete items to my grocery list

- As a user, I can add an amount to each item in the list

- As a user, I can mark an item as bought. This will cross out the title and mark the checkbox as checked.

### Technical requirements:

- For this task, we want to use NextJS as a framework

- Layouts are not strict, but the website should look good on desktop and mobile

- Please use JSON-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and React query (https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/quick-start) to mock an API integration

- MUI usage to build layouts

### Not required, but it will be a benefit

- Any additional functionality

- Server-side rendering examples
