          This page has not been refactored yet. I created it to share my
          thoughts and initial approach to solving the technical task. Its a
          draft where I outline the architecture, performance considerations,
          and handling of server-side issues. The content will be refined and
          optimized in future iterations.

              <b>Advantages</b>
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              - Provides good performance for metrics like First Contentful
              Paint and Speed Index.

            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              - The page loads first, and then the lists are fetched, causing a
              delay before the user can interact with them. This delay isnt
              ideal for SEO because search engines might not wait for the
              content to load.

            <Typography>
              - This method is better for SEO since the content is already
              available when the page loads.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              - It allows for dynamic metadata, such as custom page titles,
              which are fetched from the server.

            <Typography>
              - It takes more time to load the page because of server-side

            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              - It decreases performance metrics like First Contentful Paint and

            <Typography>
              For the <mark>grocery/list/:id</mark> page, I optimized
              performance by calling the <mark>loadingData()</mark> function
              twice: once to load the page and again to generate metadata. After
              this, the data is cached, and future requests use the cached data
              to generate the metadata, reducing the load time for subsequent
              requests.

            <Typography>
              I want to highlight two specific cases where I optimized
              performance:
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="h6" component="h3">
              1) GroceryListItem Component
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              The <mark>GroceryListItem</mark> component is wrapped in
              React.memo(), , with a custom comparison function that checks
              whether the items ID has changed. This helps avoid unnecessary
              re-renders by only re-rendering the component when its ID changes.
              This optimization reduces CPU load by preventing useless
              re-renders for items that remain unchanged in the list.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="h6" component="h3">
              2) ListItem Component
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              The <mark>ListItem</mark> component also uses React.memo() to
              prevent unnecessary re-renders. This is particularly important
              when the user interacts with individual list elements (e.g.,
              checking an item), as it ensures only the specific item being
              interacted with is re-rendered, while other list items remain
              unaffected.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              Regarding the <mark>checkedItem</mark> function, which is passed
              to <mark>ListItem</mark>: this function calls{" "}
              <mark>queryClient.getQueryData()</mark>
              to retrieve data from the current state. In my view, fetching data
              through this method is a lightweight and efficient operation,
              consuming minimal memory, time, and resources. Re-rendering
              components, on the other hand, can be more resource-intensive and
              is generally best avoided when unnecessary. Therefore, using{" "}
              <mark>React.memo()</mark>
              in this case significantly improves performance by reducing the
              number of re-renders, while querying the current state remains an
              easy and low-cost task.

              Iâ€™ve implemented basic error handling for server-side issues.
              Currently, if an issue occurs on the server, I simply render an

              environment, this approach would be enhanced to provide better
              error management and tracking.
            </Typography>
            <br />
            In a full-scale product, it would be more effective to:
